[Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)

## Algorithm

- Ask clarifying questions
- Come up with an approach, without writing any code yet
- Validate the approach with the recruiter
- Implement the solution with code
- Demonstrate correctness by running through test cases

### Data Structure

- String: represents characters in aother DS; sliding window 
- Linked List: fast-slow pointer; dummy nodes
- Queue: op: offer, poll, peek; 
- Stack: op: push, pop, peek;
- Heap: compelete binary tree in array (i -> 2i, 2i+1). Heapify: Log(n)
- Tree
- Hash Tables
- Searching
- Sorting
- Recursion

## System Design

- Not Dos (Restriction & Assumption)
- Functional Spec
- Technical Spec
- Related Problems
