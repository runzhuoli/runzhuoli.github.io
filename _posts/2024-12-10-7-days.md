## Day 1

### Coding 

- Start with [Grind 75 Leetcode list](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/a1hjvbfd/)
- Watched youtube video on [Post Order Travelsal](https://youtu.be/suPO02S0cR8?si=81_xEedsNkK5tyXk)
  - Calculate something at each node using value's from node's left and right subtree
 
### System Design

- General Approach (for business problems):
  - Requirements: Functional & Non-Functional
  - Core Entities
  - API or Interface
  - High Level Design
  - Deep Dives

PS: Only do calculation when it impact the design

- [CAP Theorem](https://youtu.be/VdrEq0cODu4?si=ngYfgrGBFrYYpjWk)
  - Partitaion failure tolerance usually is a must have. Make trade off between consistency and availability.
  - Availability: multi replicas, CDC + Eventual Consistency
  - (Strong) Consistency: distributed transactions, single active node
  - Different consistency types: Strong, Causal, Read-after-writes, Eventual
 
- [Design Youtube Top K Videos](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/top-k)
  -  Core entities: Video, View, Time Window
  -  Video view event stream
  -  Using counter to tack `<video_id, view_count>` and maintian a top-K heap
  -  Using checkpoint to recover host
  -  Handling Time window:
    - Hour Counter, Day Counter, Minute Counter
    - Two pointer approach: 1 "rising edge" add count, 3 "failiing edges" decrement the count. [Kafka offsetsForTimes](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#offsetsForTimes-java.util.Map-))

- [Design Ticket Master](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/ticketmaster)
  - Core entities: Event, Venue, Performer, Ticket, User, Booking
  - Ticket Reserving: using Redis as a distributed lock, Ticket table only needs two state: available and booked
  - High-demand Event: vitual waiting queue, estibilished a websocket connection
  - Improve Search: primary database to ElasticSearch

## Day 2

### Coding

- [Container with most water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water) : two pointers, left and right, move the smaller one in each step
- [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break): DP with two pointers:
  - `dp[i]` means sub string ends at index i can break.
  - `dp[i] = for j in 0->i: dp[j] && wordDict.contains(s.subString(j, i)`.

### System Design

- [Design Uber](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/uber)
  - Core entities: Rider, Driver, Fare, Ride, Location
  - Frequent driver location updates & efficient searches on location data:
    - real time in-memory [Geo Hash](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/geohash/) based storeage. e.g. Redis, Valkey
    - batch insert into geospatial databases, e.g. [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), which is based on [quad-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)
  - Avoid system overload from frequent driver location updates: adaptive location update intervals on client side
  - Consistent match: sending request to one driver each time, wait 10s for the next driver
  - Prevent multi ride requests sent to the same driver: using Redis as a distributed lock with TTL

- [Design Drop Box](https://youtu.be/_UZ1ngy-kOI?si=Cz5iknEuFfwtHBq)
  - Core entities: File, File Metadata, User
  - Upload file directly to S3: using S3 pre-signed URL, Download file from CDN
  - Upload large file (50 GB):
    - chunk files on client to 5mb chunk
    - add a `chunks` field in fileMetadata table. update it from S3 notification
    - identify which chunk has been uploaded: [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing))
  - Fast uploads, downloads and syncing: compression, sending multiple chunks in parallel, adaptive chunk sizes, identify which chunks have changed
  - Security: encryption in transit (HTTPs), encryption on storage, access control (signed URL with TTL)

- [Dive Deep - Kafka](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/deep-dives/kafka)
  - Terminolog and Architecture:
    - Broker: the server which hold queues.
    - Partition: the "queue". immutable, ordered. A broker can hold multiple partitions
    - Topic: a logic group of partitions
    - Producer: write data to topics
    - Consumer: read data from topics. Consumer Group - each event only processed by one consumer in the group.
  - Availability & Duriability: each partition has a leader replica (for both write and read) and a follower replica.
  - Scalability: horizontal scaling with more brokers, partitioning strategy: choose a good partition key
  - Handling Retries and Errors: retry queue, DLQ
  - Why so fast: 1. sequential disk writes 2. zero-copy IO 3. parallel processing - partitioning, 4. batching and comperssion, 5. memory-mapped files

## Day 3

### Coding

- Heap: `PriorityQueue`, offer - O(log n), poll - O(log n), peek - O(1), build a heap from unsorted arrary - O(n), heapify - O(log n)

### System Design

- [Ad Click Aggregator](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/ad-click-aggregator)
  

- [Dive Deep - Dynamo DB]()
