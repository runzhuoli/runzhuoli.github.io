## Day 1

### Coding 

- Start with Grind 75 Leetcode list: https://leetcode.com/problem-list/a1hjvbfd/
- Watched youtube video on Post Order Travelsal: https://youtu.be/suPO02S0cR8?si=81_xEedsNkK5tyXk
  - Calculate something at each node using value's from node's left and right subtree
 
### System Design

- General Approach:
  - Requirements: Functional & Non-Functional
  - Core Entities
  - API or Interface
  - Data Flow
  - High Level Design
  - Deep Dives

- CAP Theorem: https://youtu.be/VdrEq0cODu4?si=ngYfgrGBFrYYpjWk
  - Partitaion tolerance usually is a must have. Trade off between consistency and availability.
  - Strong consistency: distributed transactions, limit to a single node (likely)
  - Availability: multi replicas, CDC and eventual consistency
  - Different consistency type: Strong, Causal, Read-your-writes, Eventual
 
- Design Youtube Top K video: https://youtu.be/1lfktgZ9Eeo?si=LBUZDOu7Xvrp0SD9
  -  View data stream
  -  Using counter to track video_id : view_count and heap to track top K
  -  Using checkpoint to recover host
  -  Each consumer to update minute/hour/day counter respectively by leveraging Kafka (w lag)
  -  Would consider the AWS example: https://github.com/aws-samples/iceberg-streaming-examples
