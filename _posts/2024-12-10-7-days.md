## Day 1

### Coding 

- Start with [Grind 75 Leetcode list](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/a1hjvbfd/)
- [Post Order Travelsal](https://youtu.be/suPO02S0cR8?si=81_xEedsNkK5tyXk):
  - Calculate something at each node using value's from node's left and right subtree
 
### System Design

- General Approach (for business problems):
  - Requirements: Functional & Non-Functional
  - Core Entities
  - API or Interface
  - High Level Design
  - Deep Dives

PS: Only do calculation when it impacts the design

- [CAP Theorem](https://youtu.be/VdrEq0cODu4?si=ngYfgrGBFrYYpjWk)
  - Partitaion failure tolerance usually is a must have. Make trade off between consistency and availability.
  - Availability: multi replicas, CDC + Eventual Consistency
  - (Strong) Consistency: distributed transactions, single active node
  - Different consistency types: Strong, Causal, Read-after-writes, Eventual
 
- [Design Youtube Top K Videos](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/top-k)
  -  Core entities: Video, View, Time Window
  -  Video view event stream
  -  Using counter to tack `<video_id, view_count>` and maintian a top-K heap
  -  Using checkpoint to recover host
  -  Handling Time window:
    - Hour Counter, Day Counter, Minute Counter
    - Two pointer approach: 1 "rising edge" add count, 3 "failiing edges" decrement the count. [Kafka offsetsForTimes](https://kafka.apache.org/22/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html#offsetsForTimes-java.util.Map-))

- [Design Ticket Master](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/ticketmaster)
  - Core entities: Event, Venue, Performer, Ticket, User, Booking
  - Ticket Reserving: using Redis as a distributed lock, Ticket table only needs two state: available and booked
  - High-demand Event: vitual waiting queue, estibilished a websocket connection
  - Improve Search: primary database to ElasticSearch

## Day 2

### Coding

- [Container with most water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water) : two pointers, left and right, move the smaller one in each step
- [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/): sort array first, fix one number and use two pointers to find another two.

### System Design

- [Design Uber](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/uber)
  - Core entities: Rider, Driver, Fare, Ride, Location
  - Frequent driver location updates & efficient searches on location data:
    - real time in-memory [Geo Hash](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/geohash/) based storeage. e.g. Redis, Valkey
    - batch insert into geospatial databases, e.g. [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/), which is based on [quad-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree)
  - Avoid system overload from frequent driver location updates: adaptive location update intervals on client side
  - Consistent match: sending request to one driver each time, wait 10s for the next driver
  - Prevent multi ride requests sent to the same driver: using Redis as a distributed lock with TTL

 ![Uber](https://d248djf5mc6iku.cloudfront.net/excalidraw/7d9ec3dbaa245e568ad98d2274a21015)

- [Design Drop Box](https://youtu.be/_UZ1ngy-kOI?si=Cz5iknEuFfwtHBq)
  - Core entities: File, File Metadata, User
  - Upload file directly to S3: using S3 pre-signed URL, Download file from CDN
  - Upload large file (50 GB):
    - chunk files on client to 5mb chunk
    - add a `chunks` field in fileMetadata table. update it from S3 notification
    - identify which chunk has been uploaded: [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing))
  - Fast uploads, downloads and syncing: compression, sending multiple chunks in parallel, adaptive chunk sizes, identify which chunks have changed
  - Security: encryption in transit (HTTPs), encryption on storage, access control (signed URL with TTL)
 
![Drop Box](https://d248djf5mc6iku.cloudfront.net/excalidraw/86b27d5668364431c4df4a58213c14e5)
 
- [Dive Deep - Kafka](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/deep-dives/kafka)
  - Terminolog and Architecture:
    - Broker: the server which hold queues.
    - Partition: the "queue". immutable, ordered. A broker can hold multiple partitions
    - Topic: a logic group of partitions
    - Producer: write data to topics
    - Consumer: read data from topics.
    - Consumer Group: each event only processed by one consumer in the group.
  - Availability & Duriability: each partition has a leader replica (for both write and read) and follower replica(s).
  - Scalability: horizontal scaling with more brokers, partitioning strategy: choose a good partition key
  - Handling Retries and Errors: retry queue, DLQ
  - Why so fast: 1. sequential disk writes 2. zero-copy IO 3. parallel processing - partitioning 4. batching and comperssion 5. memory-mapped files

## Day 3

### Coding

- [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/): double linked list + hash map
- [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break): DP with two pointers:
  - `dp[i]` means sub string ends at index i can break.
  - `dp[i] = for j in 0->i: dp[j] && wordDict.contains(s.subString(j, i)`.

### System Design

- [Dive Deep - Dynamo DB](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/deep-dives/dynamodb)
  - Predictable, Low Latency, At Any Scale
  - Core Concepts:
    - Partition Key: determine the physical location of the item within the database - Consistent Hashing
    - Sort Key: used to order items with the same partition key value - B-tree
    - Global Secondary Index (GSI): an index with a partition key and optional sort key that differs from the table's partition key. (up to 20 GSIs per table)
    - Local Secondary Index (LSI): an index with the same partition key as the table's primary key but a different sort key. (up to 5 LSIs per table)
  - Consistency Types:
    - Eventual Consistency: writes to a primary replica, replicated to seondary ones async; reads are served by any replica.
    - Strong Consistency: use Multi-Paxos for writes; reads reflect the most recent write, are routed to leader replica.
    - Conflict resolution: last writer wins
    - Transaction Support: two-phase commit protocol across muliple partitions.
  - [AWS re:Invent 2024 - Dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB (DAT406)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qzs8mU5dgx4)
    - Partition Metadata Lookup: Request Route (local cache) -> MemDS <- Partition Publisher --poll-- Storage Node.
    - [mRSC Global Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/multi-region-strong-consistency-gt.html): global read-after-write consistency. 

## Day 4

### Coding

- Heap: complete binary tree. `PriorityQueue` in Java.
  - Binary heap: tree root at index 0, for node at index i: children at 2i+1 and 2i+2, parent at floor((i-1)/2)
  - Time complexity: find-min: O(1), delete-min: O(log n), decrease-key: O(log n), insert: O(log n), build-heap: O(n)

### System Design

- General Approach (for infrastructure problems):
  - Requirements: Functional & Non-Functional
  - System Interface & Data Flow
  - High Level Design
  - Deep Dives

- [Ad Click Aggregator](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/ad-click-aggregator)
  - Ad click redirect: server side redirect
  - Do not lose any click data:
    - retention period on stream
    - reconciliation: store raw data and use an offline job to recalculate metrics
  - Prevent abuse from users clicking: generate unique impressions id on server side, signed impression id with a secret key, use a distributed cache to verify whether it exists
 
![add click](https://d248djf5mc6iku.cloudfront.net/excalidraw/cd61f21a840b6ef7bea025dbc53a8389)

- [Facebook News Feed/Twitter](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/fb-news-feed)
  - Core entities: User, Follow, Post
  - Handle users who following a large number of users: maintian a precomputed `Feed` table.
  - Handle users with a large number of followers: use an aync feed worker, ignore users with large followers, hybrid approach when read
  - Uneven reads of Posts table: redundant post cacche

- [Find median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream): two heaps: one max heap for numbers on the left side, one min heap for numbers on the right side.
 
### System Design

- [Dive Deep - Log-Structured Merge Tree in Database]
  - writes in a fast in-memory data structure (e.g. red-black tree, AVL tree)
  - flush to disk as an immutable table (SSTable)
  - periodically, small on-disk files are mreged into large sorted files
  - reads are sreved by first checking the in-memory structure, followed by searching disk-based sorted files.
  - bloom filter/sparse index are used for quickly determine if a key exists in a specific file.
